		<p class="about-aamod">
			I naturally resonate at the intersection of art and science. It’s where my curiosity thrives and where my experience comes to life. Wrench and Render was born out of that space: a blend of technical problem-solving and artistic expression. The name reflects both a hands-on approach to building systems and solving problems, as well as a passion for creating work that resonates deeply and beautifully.
			<br><br>
			Over my 15 year career at NASA, I designed hardware, developed sensors, and troubleshot complex systems often learning entirely new technical skills on the fly. But what I came to value most in engineering was the creative process: making unexpected connections, dreaming up novel solutions, and shaping something entirely new.
			<br><br>
			Alongside that technical journey, I developed a deep appreciation for the arts. Art has a unique power in that it stirs awe, communicates profound ideas in ways words alone cannot, and brings people together.
			Through Wrench and Render, I seek to bring both worlds together. Right now, that looks like using my interest in drones (an area where I find genuine enjoyment and fascination) to create captivating videos. Whether it's helping people tell their stories or providing unique perspectives, I aim to make both the process and the outcome beautiful. Let me come alongside what you’re already doing and help bring a little art and science into it.
			<br><br>
			I am a FAA Part 107 licensed drone pilot and my experience working at a flight research center has helped me develop a mentality and appreciation
			for conducting flights with safety and effectiveness in mind.

			<p class="about-hera">"Hera Syndulla"</p>
			<p class="details-hera">Hera Syndulla is known in the Star Wars world as one of the Rebellion’s most gifted pilots among her many other talents. 
				She flies with intention, precision, and an unshakable sense of control.<br><br>
					That's what inspired the naming of this ship in the fleet. Hera Syndulla, a Mavic 3 Pro Cine, is built for deliberate, cinematic flight. 
					With exceptional stability, long flight time, and impressive speed for its class, it excels at capturing precise and beautiful outdoor shots. 
					From slow, composed reveals to sweeping dynamic movements, this drone thrives when a cinematic shot is a must.
					With the ability to shoot in ProRes RAW, it delivers uncompromising image quality and color depth, allowing for a variety of workflows to make the perfectly beautiful shot.

			<p class="about-poe">"Poe Dameron"</p>
			<p class="details-poe">Poe Dameron is famous in the Star Wars world for flying fast, flying close, and flying where others wouldn’t dare. 
				A hotshot ace with sharp instincts, he turns chaos into choreography and thrives in complex maneuvering. <br><br>
				That's what drove the name of this DJI Avata 2 in the fleet. Compact, agile, and protected by shrouded propeller guards, this drone is designed to move 
				confidently through tight indoor spaces and complex environments with safety and control. It delivers high quality, high fps video that makes fast motion feel fluid and immersive. 
				Once outside, with manual mode capable, the Avata 2 reaches higher speeds and offers far more freedom for aggressive lines, sharp turns, and dynamic, FPV-style shots that place the viewer directly inside the action.
				From both sweeping indoor shots to exciting dynamic outdoor shots, this ship can get some great shots.
